      <h2 id="tiger">Facts about Tiger</h2>
      <img src="Images/tiger_bg.jfif"  alt="Tiger" class="imagee">
     <p>Tigers are easily recognizable with their dark vertical stripes and reddish fur. The <em>Bengal</em> tiger is the most common tiger. Tigers live between 20-26 
        years in the wild. Adult tigers generally live alone. They are great swimmers and actually they like the water. Overall, wild tiger numbers are starting to tick upward. Tiger populations 
        are stable or increasing in <em>India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russian and China.</em> An estimated 3,900 
        tigers remain in the wild. </p>
      
       <h2 id="lion">Facts about Lion</h2>
       <img src="Images/lion3.jfif"  alt="Lion" class="imagee">
       <p >Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.

        Unlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of the pride is determined 
        by the availability of food and water. If resources are scarce, the pride becomes smaller.</p>
  
        <h2 id="polar">Facts about Polar Bear</h2>
        <img src="Images/polo.jfif"  alt="Polar Bear" class="imagee">
        <p >The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic. The polar bear's Latin
        name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around, or on the ocean–predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.</p>
  
        <h2  id="orangutan">Facts about Orangutan</h2>
        <img src="Images/orangutan5.jpg"  alt="Orangutan" class="imagee">
        <p>The name orangutan means "man of the forest" in the Malay language. Bornean and Sumatran orangutans differ a little in appearance and behavior. Orangutans are the largest arboreal mammal, spending most of their time in
             trees. Long, powerful arms and grasping hands and feet allow them to move through the branches. These great apes share 96.4% of our genes and are highly intelligent creatures.</p>
  
        <h2  id="panda">Facts about Giant Panda</h2>
        <img src="Images/panda4.jfif"  alt="Panda" class="imagee">
        <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are
             eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
  
        <h2 id="elephant">Facts about Elephant</h2>
        <img src="Images/elephant2.jfif"  alt="Elephant" class="imagee">
        <p >Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they're one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a 
            similar physique. Most experts recognize two species of elephant: the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), who live on separate continents and have many unique features. </p>
  
        <h2 id="gorilla">Facts about Gorilla</h2>
        <img src="Images/gorilla.jfif"  alt="Gorilla" class="imagee">
        <p>Gorillas are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. Gorillas are gentle giants and display many human-like behaviors and emotions, such as laughter
                         and sadness. The largest of the great apes, gorillas are stocky animals with broad chests and shoulders, large, human-like hands, and small eyes set into hairless faces.</p>
        <h2  id="rhino">Facts about Rhino</h2>
        <img src="Images/rhino3.jpg"  alt="rhino" class="imagee">
      <p>Our planet is home to five species of rhinoceros – the black rhino and the white rhino, which live in Africa, and the Sumatran, Javan and Indian (or greater one-horned) rhino, which inhabit the tropical forests and swamps of
          Asia. These incredible creatures are some of the biggest animals in world! The largest of the five species is the white rhino, which can grow to 1.8m tall and and weigh a massive 2,500kg – that’s the weight of 30 men!</p>
           
         <h2 id="seals">Facts about Seals</h2>
         <img src="Images/seal2.jfif"  alt="Seal" class="imagee">
             <p>Seals are carnivores, eating mainly fish, though some also consume squid, other mollusks, and crustaceans. Unlike other seals, the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) of the Antarctic feeds largely on penguins, seabirds, 
            and other seals, in addition to fish and krill. Flatfish, lesser sandeel and cod species are their favorite food, although what they eat can vary per season, depending upon what's available.</p>
                
       
            <h2 id="dolphin">Facts about Dolphins</h2>
            <img src="Images/dolphin.jfif"  alt="Dolphin" class="imagee">
            <p>Dolphin, any of the toothed whales belonging to the mammal family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) as well as the families Platanistidae and Iniidae, the two that contain the river dolphins. Of the nearly 40 species of dolphins
                 in the Delphinidae, 6 are commonly called whales, including the killer whale and the pilot whales. The name dolphin is also applied to members of the fish genus Coryphaena (family Coryphaenidae).</p>
      
             <h2  id="shark">Facts about Sharks</h2>
             <img src="Images/shark2.jfif"  alt="shark" class="imagee">
             <p>Sharks use their gills to filter oxygen from the water. They are a special type of fish known as "elasmobranchs", which translates into fish made of cartilaginous tissues—the clear gristly stuff that your ears and nose tip are made of.
              This category also includes rays, sawfish, and skates. </p>
           
                  
              <h2  id="whale">Facts about Whale</h2>
              <img src="Images/ale2.jfif"  alt="Whale" class="imagee">
              <p>The blue whale is the largest animal that ever lived and can grow to 90 or more feet and weigh as much as 24 elephants.  Some species of whales are among the longest lived mammals. Scientists estimate bowhead whales (a baleen whale found 
                  in the Arctic) can live for more than 200 years, and killer whales (a toothed whale found in various habitats worldwide) can live for more than 100 years. </p>
