            <li class="side1"><h3>Due to Land conversion for development</h3>The conversion of lands that once provided wildlife habitat to housing developments, roads, 
                office parks, strip malls, parking lots and industrial sites continues, even during the current economic crisis.</li>
            <li class="side1"><h3>Water development</h3>Dams and other water diversions siphon off and disconnect waters, changing hydrology and water chemistry.</li>
            <li class="side1"><h3>Agriculture</h3>Much of the habitat loss from agriculture was done long ago when settlers converted forests and prairies to cropland.
                 Today, there is increasing pressure to redevelop conservation lands for high-priced food and biofuel crops.</li>
                 <li class="side1"><h3>Climate change</h3>The emerging driver of habitat loss is climate change. Wildlife that need the cool temperatures of high elevations,
                      such as the American pika, may soon run out of habitat. Coastal wildlife may find their habitat underwater as sea levels rise.</li>
                      <li class="side1"><h3>Pollution</h3>Freshwater wildlife are most impacted by pollution. Pollutants such as untreated sewage, mining waste, acid rain, 
                          fertilizers and pesticides concentrate in rivers, lakes and wetlands and eventually end up in estuaries and the food web.</li>

      <h2>Threat to animals - WHY??</h2>
      <img src="Images/fur_reason.jfif" class="fur" alt="Fur"> <img src="Images/fur2.jfif" class="fur1" alt="Fur2">
       <p class="color">Each year over 100 million animals, including millions of 
           dogs and cats, are killed for their fur on fur farms around the globe. 
           The majority of the fur trade’s skins originate from animals who are 
           confined and killed on fur farms. Millions more animals are victims of 
           trapping; caught in the wild using spring traps with metal teeth that 
           smash bone and tear muscle.</p>
       <img src="Images/fur.jfif" class="fur2" alt="Fur">
       <img src="Images/fur1.jfif" class="fur2" alt="Fur1">

       <h2>ByCatch: One more step to kill these loving creatures.</h2>
       <img src="Images/bycatch.jfif" class="fur2" alt="bycatch">
       <img src="Images/bycatch1.jfif" class="fur2" alt="bycatch1">
       <img src="Images/bycatch2.jfif" class="fur3"  alt="bycatch2">
       <img src="Images/bycatch3.jfif" class="fur3"  alt="bycatch3">
       <p class="color">Wherever there is fishing, there is bycatch—the incidental capture of non-target species such
            as dolphins, marine turtles and seabirds. Thousands of miles of nets and lines are set in the world's oceans
             each day. Modern fishing gear, often undetectable by sight and extremely strong, is very efficient at catching the 
             desired fish species—as well as anything else in its path. A staggering amount of marine life—including turtles,
              dolphins and juvenile fish—is hauled up with the catch, and then discarded overboard dead or dying.</p>

              <h2>Illegal Trading- heartless act</h2>
              <img src="Images/illegal.jfif" class="fur2" alt="illegal trade">
              <img src="Images/illegal1.jfif" class="fur2" alt="illegal trade1">
              <img src="Images/illegal2.jfif" class="fur3"  alt="illegal trade2">

              <p class = "color">Wildlife crime is a big business. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal
                   parts are trafficked much like illegal drugs and arms. Some examples of illegal wildlife trade are well 
                   known, such as poaching of elephants for ivory and tigers for their skins and bones. However, countless other 
                   species are similarly overexploited, from marine turtles to timber trees. Not all wildlife trade is illegal.
                    Wild plants and animals from tens of thousands of species are caught or harvested from the wild and then sold
                     legitimately as food, pets, ornamental plants, leather, tourist ornaments and medicine. Wildlife trade escalates 
                     into a crisis when an increasing proportion is illegal and unsustainable—directly threatening the survival of many
                      species in the wild.</p>
